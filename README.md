# Predictive Sales Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis

This project develops a robust sales forecasting model using **time series analysis (SARIMA)** to help businesses make data-driven decisions for inventory management, budgeting, and strategic planning.

## Project Overview

Sales forecasting is critical for business operations. This project:

- Uses the **Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA)** model for forecasting
- Handles data cleaning, preprocessing, and time series decomposition
- Provides reliable sales forecasts to guide operational and strategic decisions

## Key Insights

- The SARIMA model captured both trend and seasonality in sales data effectively.
- Forecasted sales for the next 30 days with reasonable accuracy based on historical patterns.
- Visualised sales trends to identify seasonal peaks and troughs for planning.

## Tools Used

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels  
- **Platform:** Google Colab
